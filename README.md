## 🧠 What I learned

This project helped me reinforce and apply:

1. **Variables and scoring logic**  
   Using variables to track scores for each house based on user answers.

2. **Multi-line strings and user input**  
   Displaying formatted questions with `"""..."""` and capturing responses with `input()`.

3. **Dictionaries and `max()` function**  
   Using a Python dictionary to compare final scores and determine the winner efficiently.
